Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, 
youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge 
them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
